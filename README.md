# IPL Predictor
It is a machine learning project in which we can predict the result of the ongoing match using the previous matches data. The model is trained on the data of the matches between 2008 and 2019 played by all the teams. It uses Logistic Regression to predict the winning percentage of the batting team based on the current score and condition of the team. The winning prediction also depend on the factor whether the batting team is playing a home match or an away match. So, the trained model takes every aspect of the data and predicts the winning percentage.
